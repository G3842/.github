I have been working on 5-D Vortex modelling in terms of Infinite Game-theoretic analysis. 380 degrees Lie Group. I have come to the conclusion that the Proof (IFF) must finally be Self-referential. On the basis of what I consider to be Self-Referential Proof, Try reseting the scalling to Y = 5 (cardinal), 2Y = 10 (ordinal) and 2(2Y) = 20 (Univeral). Natural log is base 20. All of this is determined by the fingers on our two hands. (The Devine told us so.)
